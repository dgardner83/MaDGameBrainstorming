for the game engine we are currently primarly considering Godot, it is free and Opensource. 
	Howerever in the future we may wnt to consider other engines becouse they are better supported or more performant
		for example Unity or Unreal.
		
I(Mike) think that a 2d game would be the best choice for our first game, it will be much easier to code and create art and other assets for.
I(Dan) agree with Mike's initial assessments.
